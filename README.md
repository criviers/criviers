- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Riviers
        I am 32 years old. I have always been more mechanically inclined, but recently decided to try something completely different to challenge myself. I am self taught and
        can build a functional, not so pretty, website. I am working on that though, as well as finding new code (to me) to implement on sites for different functionalities. 
        My Goal, is to get good enough to land my first job or gig for a front-end developer, then become proficient enough to work from home. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
        family
        coding
        learning
        outdoor activities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
        HTML/CSS
        determining what additional languages would be best
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
        front-end development 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
